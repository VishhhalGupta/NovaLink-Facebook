This document explains how to successfully call the Pages API to post to your Page.

Before You Start
You will need the following:

A Facebook Page, this can be an unpublished or published Page on which you can perform the CREATE_CONTENT task.
A Page access token for the Page
The following permissions:
pages_manage_metadata
pages_manage_posts
pages_manage_read_engagement
pages_show_list
Best Practices
When testing an API call, you can include the access_token parameter set to your access token. However, when making secure calls from your app, use the access token class.

Step 1. Get Your Page ID
To get a list of IDs and Page access tokens for Facebook Pages on which you can perform a task, send a GET request to /user_id/accounts endpoint where user_id is your user ID.

Example Request
Formatted for readability. Replace bold, italics values, such as page_id, with your values.
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/user_id/accounts?access_token=user_access_token"
On success, your app receives the following JSON response that includes an array of objects. Each object contains information about a specific Page including the name, ID, a short-lived Page access token, tasks you can perform on the Page, and more:

{
  "data": [
    {
      "access_token": "page_access_token",
      "category": "Internet Company",
      "category_list": [
        {
          "id": "2256",
          "name": "Internet Company"
        }
      ],
      "name": "Name of this Page",
      "id": "page_id",
      "tasks": [
        "ANALYZE",
        "ADVERTISE",
        "MODERATE",
        "CREATE_CONTENT"
      ]
    },
...
Step 2. Publish a post
To publish a post, send a POST request to the /page_id/feed endpoint, where page_id is the ID for the Page you are publishing to, with the message parameter set to your message content and the access_token parameter set to the Page access token:

Example Request
Formatted for readability. Replace bold, italics values, such as page_id, with your values.
curl -X POST "https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/page_id/feed" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "message":"your_message_text",
           "access_token":"page_access_token",
         }'
Your post will be published immediately.

On success, your app receives the following JSON response with the ID for the post:

{
  "id": "page_post_id" 
}
Visit your Facebook Page  to view the post.

Step 3. Verify Your Post
To verify that the post was published to your Page, send a GET request to the /page_id/feed endpoint:

Example Request
Formatted for readability. Replace bold, italics values, such as page_id, with your values.
      curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v24.0/page_id/feed?access_token=page_access_token"
On success, your app will receive the following JSON response with an array of objects. Each object includes the post ID, the message content, and the time the post was created:

{
  "data": [
    {
      "created_time": "2020-03-25T17:33:34+0000",
      "message": "Hello World!",
      "id": "422575694827569_917077345377399"  
    },
...
  ]
}
Use the Graph Explorer
The Graph Explorer tool is a UI that allows you to experiment with Facebook APIs without adding code to your app or website. You can select permissions, get access tokens, test GET, POST, and DELETE methods, and get code snippets of these queries for Android, iOS, JavaScript, PHP, and cURL.

Note, you will need a Facebook App ID to use the Graph Explorer.

Step 1. Get Your Page ID
Select the the pages_manage_metadata, pages_manage_posts, pages_manage_read_engagement, and pages_show_list permissions, which ever appear within the Permission dropdown menu, set the GET request to the /me/accounts endpoint in the query box, and click Submit.


Click on the ID of your Page, displayed directly beneath the name of your Page, to move the ID to the query box.

Step 2. Post as a Page
Under the User or Page drop down menu, select the Page access token for your Page. Next, set the method to POST with a request to the /{page-id}/feed endpoint, then set the Params key to message and the value to your post text. Click Submit.

On success, the Graph Explorer will show the ID of the Page post.


Visit your Facebook Page to view the post.

Step 3. Verify Your Post
Send a GET request to the /page-id/feed endpoint.

On success, the Graph Explorer will display the time the post was created, the text of the post, and the ID of the Page post.
